**BAKERY QUEUE SIMULATION - SINGLE-SERVER QUEUING MODEL**

***Introduction***

A Single-Server Queuing Model is a mathematical model used to represent situations where customers arrive at a service point and are served one by one in the order of their arrival. This type of queuing model is commonly used in various fields, such as retail, banking, and customer service, to simulate real-life scenarios and analyze the behavior of queues.

In this project, we simulate a bakery queue using the Single-Server Queuing Model. The bakery has only one server (the baker), and customers arrive at the bakery, waiting for service in a line. As the customers wait, the server serves them one by one. This simulation is visualized using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive experience.

***Objective***
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the behavior of a Single-Server Queuing Model by simulating customers arriving at the bakery, waiting in line, and being served one at a time by the server.

***Key Features:***
Add customers to the queue.

Serve customers one by one.

Display status updates such as "Waiting for customers", "Customers waiting", "Serving customer", and "No customers in queue".

Animation effects for customers arriving, waiting in line, and being served.

***What is a Single-Server Queuing Model?***
In a Single-Server Queuing Model, there is only one service point (in this case, the baker), and customers arrive in random intervals. They are served in the order of their arrival, one at a time. This model is typically denoted as M/M/1 in queuing theory, where:

M stands for Markovian (memoryless) arrival process (Poisson process).

M stands for Markovian (memoryless) service process (Exponential distribution).

1 indicates there is only one server.

The goal of using this model is to understand how the system behaves in terms of waiting times, service times, and the overall efficiency of the system.

***Example:***
Imagine a bakery where there is only one baker serving customers. Customers arrive one by one, and the baker serves them as they come. If the bakery is busy, new customers have to wait in line until the baker is free. The Single-Server Queuing Model simulates this scenario.
